Network Spoofer
===============

Network Spoofer lets you change websites on other people's computers from an Android phone.

Features include:
* Flip pictures upside down
* Flip text upside down
* Make websites experience gravity
* Redirect websites to other pages
* Delete random words from websites
* Replace words on websites with others
* Change all pictures to Trollface
* Wobble all pictures / graphics around a bit
* A few custom modes for you to have your own fun!

Please note that there is no intention for Network Spoofer to include any malicious features. This application is a fun demonstration of how vulnerable home networks are to simple attacks, with permission of the network owner - DO NOT attempt to use Network Spoofer on any corporate or other non-residential networks (eg. at school, university). It becomes very obvious when Network Spoofer is being used on a Network, and use of Network Spoofer will be considered malicious hacking by network administrators.
